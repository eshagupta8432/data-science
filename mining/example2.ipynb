There are many things to be liked about, but only two things are bad. While charging it takes an effort to insert the cable just because of the hole which is given and same is the case while taking it out. Also the sync pair is not available which can be negligible for some people. Leaving all these issues, these earbuds are great.READ MORERaghav ShivhareCertified Buyer, IndoreMay, 2023255119PermalinkReport Abuse4Nice productALL very good but Noise Cancellation Very Bad üòîREAD MORERohit  YadavCertified Buyer, PrayagrajMay, 2023155PermalinkReport Abuse4Good quality productThis tws is very good looking and very primium build quality .
